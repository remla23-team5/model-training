model-training
==============================

Welcome to model-training, the place where the restaurant sentiment analysis model for the remla23 project is trained

In order to (only) preprocess the data, use:
```make
make data
```

In order to train the model with the data from previous step, use:
```make
make train
```

other commands can be found in Makefile.

## DVC

Check how the DVC pipeline looks like, use:

```shell
dvc dag
```

Check a DAG of the dependencies of all the artifacts, use:

```shell
dvc dag --outs
```

Run the experiment, use:

```shell
dvc exp run
```

Check the experiment log, use:

```shell
dvc exp show
```
